This project provides a simple and straightforward way to integrate the Google Gemini API into your applications.  It aims to abstract away the complexities of authentication, request formatting, and response parsing, allowing you to focus on leveraging Gemini's powerful AI capabilities in your projects.  Whether you're building a chatbot, generating creative content, or analyzing data, this library can help you get started quickly and easily.

## Features

*   **Simplified API Interaction:**  Provides a high-level interface for interacting with the Gemini API, simplifying common tasks like text generation, image understanding, and more.
*   **Authentication Management:** Handles API key management securely and efficiently.  Supports environment variable configuration for secure key storage.
*   **Request and Response Handling:**  Automatically formats requests according to the Gemini API specifications and parses responses into easily usable data structures.
*   **Error Handling:**  Provides robust error handling and informative error messages to help you debug your applications.
*   **Extensible Design:**  Designed to be easily extended with new features and capabilities as the Gemini API evolves.
*   **Example Code:**  Includes comprehensive examples demonstrating how to use the library for various tasks.
*   **Clear Documentation:**  Well-documented codebase and README to get you up and running quickly.

## Installation

To install the library, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # If you have a requirements.txt file

# OR (if you don't have a requirements.txt file, install the necessary dependencies directly.  Replace 'google-generativeai' with the actual Gemini API package name if it differs)
pip install google-generativeai
```

**Prerequisites:**

*   Python 3.7 or higher.
*   A Google Cloud project with the Gemini API enabled.
*   A valid API key for the Gemini API.

## Usage Examples

**1. Basic Text Generation:**

```python
import google.generativeai as genai

# Configure the Gemini API
genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Select the model
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro') # Or 'gemini-pro-vision' for multimodal

# Generate text
response = model.generate_content("Write a short poem about the moon.")

# Print the generated text
print(response.text)
```

**2. Image Captioning (using `gemini-pro-vision` model):**

```python
import google.generativeai as genai
from PIL import Image  # Import Pillow library for image handling

# Configure the Gemini API
genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Select the model
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro-vision')

# Load the image
image = Image.open("path/to/your/image.jpg") # Replace with your image path

# Generate a caption for the image
response = model.generate_content([image, "Describe this image."])

# Print the generated caption
print(response.text)
```

**3.  Setting the API Key via Environment Variable:**

For enhanced security, it's recommended to set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"  # Replace with your actual API key
```

Then, in your Python code:

```python
import os
import google.generativeai as genai

# Configure the Gemini API using the environment variable
genai.configure(api_key=os.environ.get("GOOGLE_API_KEY"))

# Rest of your code...
```

**Important Notes:**

*   Remember to replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual Gemini API key.
*   For image processing, make sure you have the `Pillow` library installed: `pip install Pillow`
*   Refer to the official Gemini API documentation for more advanced usage and options.  (Link to Gemini API Docs if available).  This project aims to simplify common use cases, but the full API offers much more flexibility.
